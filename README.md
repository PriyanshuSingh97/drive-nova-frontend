# 🚗 DriveNova — Frontend

- This is the frontend of the DriveNova project — a premium car rental platform featuring animated UI, dark mode toggle, category filtering, search, booking history and integrated authentication via Google/GitHub OAuth with JWT handoff from the backend.  
- The client consumes REST APIs for cars, bookings, and contact, and manages session state via localStorage.

# DriveNova Frontend

- This is the frontend of the *DriveNova* project â€” a premium car rental platform featuring animated UI, dark mode toggle, category filtering, search, and integrated authentication via Google/GitHub OAuth with JWT handoff from the backend. The client consumes REST APIs for cars, bookings, and contact, and manages session state via localStorage.
- It is designed to deliver speed, security, and interactivity while connecting with the backend services for authentication, car listings, and bookings.
